<p>My current PhD work focuses on restoring lower urinary tract function. About 1 in 5 people will
    experience impaired bladder function, but despite this widespread impact it is often overlooked. 
    Poor bladder function can come from many neurological conditions, including spinal cord injury, 
    Parkinson's Disease, and more. Below, I highlight several specific projects I have worked on in this lab and previously. 
    For a complete set of publications, my Google Scholar page can be found <a href="http://bit.ly/mariajantz">here</a>
    and my full CV is accessible <a href="links.html">here</a>. I am happy to send a copy of any papers on request.</p>

<h2>Predicting stimulation-evoked bladder function based on neural activity</h2>
<p>Current systems to restore bladder control are inconsistent + testing time is forever.

<h2>Selective recruitment of lower urinary tract nerves with epidural spinal cord stimulation</h2>
<p>Although nerve stimulation has been explored as an intervention to improve bladder control, placing 
    nerve cuffs for stimulation clinically would be a difficult procedure to distribute widely. Epidural spinal 
    cord stimulation, however, is a common procedure. Here, we show that it is possible to access the pelvic 
    and pudendal nerves that innervate the lower urinary tract directly with epidural spinal cord stimulation. 
    Additionally, using a high-density electrode array we are typically able to find electrodes that will
    recruit these nerves selectively (to the exclusion of any other instrumented nerves).
