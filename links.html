    <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
    <p>I am passionate about teaching, and have taught students ranging in age from 4th grade to graduate students. 
        I received a CTSI certification for STEM teaching in 2020, and I regularly guest lecture on neural 
        engineering topics such as the Cable Equation. At the University of Pittsburgh, I was a TA for graduate Neural Engineering as well as 
        undergraduate Digital Signal Processing. I now co-facilitate the BIOENG 2900 Fellowship Writing class, 
        for which I helped redesign the syllabus to focus on effective scientific communication.
    <p>In addition to graduate-level teaching, I have <b>authored curricula</b> to teach programming concepts to students
        at the K-12 level. The first of these is a workshop found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Python-essentials-anyone-fifth-ebook/dp/B076D5NSMV">here</a> 
        on the basics of Python programming through game design. I have used this curriculum to teach a clinic for middle school girls, 
        and another clinic for underrepresented minority students who had aged out of the foster care system. I have also 
        adapted Georgia Tech's brilliant EarSketch curriculum as a 6-week course for 4th graders to learn Python through music. 
        I taught this curriculum at Pittsburgh's Miller African-Centered Academy. For all of the materials from that course, you are 
        welcome to contact me.

    <h2>Outreach</h2>
    <p>In addition to teaching clinics and class units at the K-12 level focused on women and 
        underrepresented minorities in STEM, I aim to improve access to STEM through diversity training and discussions, 
        undergraduate recruitment, and policy changes at the lab and department level. 
        Outside of the lab, I also work on efforts to improve voting access and participate in the Empty Bowls Project, 
        a fundraising effort supporting local food banks.
    </p>
    <p>
        As part of my efforts for inclusion and diversity in lab, I have helped run a seminar and discussion series covering, 
        among other things, the following topics: 
        <ul>
        <li>
            Gender & Sexuality in STEM
        </li>
        <li>
