    <p>I received a CTSI certification for STEM teaching in 2020, and I regularly guest lecture on neural

        for which I helped redesign the syllabus to include a focus on scientific communication. Previously, I 
        authored a workshop <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Python-essentials-anyone-fifth-ebook/dp/B076D5NSMV">curriculum
             on teaching the basics of Python programming</a>.
