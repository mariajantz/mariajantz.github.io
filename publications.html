<p>Below are several projects I have worked on...for more info - Include link to google scholar (and ORCiD?)</p>

<div class="project">
<h2>Predicting stimulation-evoked bladder function based on neural activity</h2>
<p>My current PhD work focuses on restoring impaired bladder function. About 1 in 5 people will
    experience impaired bladder function, and it's one of those things that you don't notice until
    it's gone at which point you desperately want it back...
    Bladder control is SUPER DUPER IMPORTANT... figure out
    how to consistently get it. Gaunt lab, show a figure</p>
</div>
<div class="project">
<h2>Selective recruitment of lower urinary tract nerves with epidural spinal cord stimulation</h2>
<p>Bladder control again, paper shows it is possible to access nerves that innervate the bladder 
    from epidural stimulation on sacral spinal cord. + selectivity
</p>

<div class="project">
<h2>Brain-controlled functional electrical stimulation for locomotion</h2>
<p>Lee Miller + Matt Tresch, paper, figure</p>
